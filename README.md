Sample Selenium code for an Intuit Technical Interview

Hello! This is a very small sample Selenium WebDriver test suite that runs a couple of tests against intuit.com!

To avoid any potential issues with browser installations, I decided to utilize a test account from Browserstacks.com. Instead of specifying local browser executables, I have included the credentials of this test account so the WebDriver can access the Browserstacks hub and let them worry about having the proper executables.

The project was built in IntelliJ and uses Maven to manage its dependencies. To run the tests simply open a command line at the repository directory and run 'mvn test'
